      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p class="body">
      OK, so you have finally decided to write your own check.
      Welcome aboard, this is really a fun thing to do.  There are
      actually two kinds of checks, so before you can start, you have
      to find out which kind of check you want to implement.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      The functionality of Checkstyle is implemented in modules that
      can be plugged into Checkstyle. Modules can be containers for
      other modules, i.e. they form a tree structure. The toplevel
      modules that are known directly to the Checkstyle kernel (which
      is also a module and forms the root of the tree) are
      FileSetChecks. These are pretty simple to grasp: they take a set
      of input files and fire error messages.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      Checkstyle provides a few FileSetCheck implementations by
      default and one of them happens to be the TreeWalker. A
      TreeWalker typically has some submodules, called Checks. The
      TreeWalker operates by seperately transforming each of the java
      input files into an abstract syntax tree and then handing the
      result over to each of the Check submodules which in turn have a
      look at a certain aspect of the tree.
      </p>

      <a name="checks"></a>
      <h2>Writing Checks</h2>
      <p class="body">

      Most of the functionality of Checkstyle is implemented as
      Checks. If you know how to write your own Checks, you can extend
      Checkstyle according to your needs without having to wait for
      the checkstyle development team. You are about to become a
      Checkstyle Expert.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      Suppose you have a convention that the number of methods in a
      class should not exceed a certain limit, say 30. This rule makes
      sense, a class should only do one thing and do it well. With a
      zillion methods chances are that the class does more than one
      thing. The only problem you have is that your convention is not
      checked by Checkstyle, so you'll have to write your own check
      and plug it into the Checkstyle framework.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      This chapter is organized as a tour that takes you through the
      process step by step and explains both the theoretical
      foundations and the Checkstyle API along the way.
      </p>

      <a name="grammar"></a>
      <h3>Java Grammar</h3>
      <p class="body">
      Every Java Program is structured into files, and each of these
      files has a certain structure. For example, if there is a
      package statement then it is the first line of the file that is
      not comment or whitespace. After the package statement comes a
      list of import statements, which is followed by a class or
      interface definition, and so on.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
      If you have ever read an introductory level Java book you probably
      knew all of the above. And if you have studied computer science,
      you probably also know that the rules that specify the Java Language
      can be formally specified using a Grammar (statement is simplified
      for didactic purposes).
      </p>
      <p class="body">
      Tools exist which read a grammar definition and produce a parser
      for the language that is specified in the grammar. In other
      words the output of the tool is a program that can transform a
      stream of characters (a Java File) into a tree representation
      that reflects the structure of the file. CheckStyle uses the
      parser generator <a href="http://www.antlr.org">ANTLR</a> but
      that is an implementation detail you do not need to worry about
      when writing checks. Several other parser generators exist and
      they all work well.
      </p>

      <a name="gui"></a>
      <h3>The Checkstyle SDK gui</h3>
      <p class="body">
      Still with us? Great, you have mastered the basic theory so here
      is your reward - a gui that displays the structure of a Java
      source file. To run it type
      <pre>
      java -classpath checkstyle-all-${version}.jar com.puppycrawl.toos.checkstyle.gui.Main
      </pre>
      </p>
      <p class="body">
      on the command line. Click the button at the botton of the frame
      and select a syntactically correct Java source file. The frame
      will be populated with a tree that corresponds to the structure
      of the java source code.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      TODO: screenshot
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      In the leftmost column you can open and close branches of the
      tree, the remaining columns display information about each node
      in the tree.  The second column displays a token type for each
      node. As you navigate from the root of the tree to one of the
      leafs, you'll notice that the token type denotes smaller and
      smaller units of your source file, i.e. close to the root you
      might see the token type CLASS_DEF (a node that represents a
      class definition) while you will see token types like IDENT (an
      identifier) near the leafs of the tree.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      We'll get back to the details in the other columns later, they
      are important for implementing checks but not for understanding
      the basic concepts. For now it is sufficient to know that the
      gui is a tool that lets you look at the structure of a java
      file, i.e. you can see the java grammar 'in action'.
      </p>

      <a name="visitor"></a>
      <h3>Understanding the visitor pattern</h3>
      <p class="body">
      Ready for a bit more theory? OK, here it comes: The last bit
      that is missing before you can start writing checks is that you have
      to understand the Vistor pattern.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      When working with ASTs, a simple approach to define check operations
      on them would be to add a check() method to the Class that defines
      the AST nodes. For example, our AST type could have a method
      checkNumberOfMethods(). Such an approach would suffer from a few
      serious drawbacks. Most importantly, it does not provide an extensible
      design, i.e. the checks have to be known at compile time, there is no
      way to write plugins.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      Hence Checkstyle's AST classes do not have any methods that implement
      checking functionality. Instead, Checkstyle's TreeWalker takes a set
      of objects that conform to a Check interface. OK, you're right -
      actually it's not an interface but an abstract class to provides
      some helper methods. A Check provides
      methods that take an AST as an argument and perform the checking
      process for that AST, most prominently <span
      class="code">visitToken()</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="body">

      It is important to understand that the individual Checks do no
      drive the AST traversal. Instead, the TreeWalker initiates a recursive
      descend from the root of the AST to the leaf nodes and calls the Check
      methods.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      Before any visitor method is called, the TreeWalker will call
      beginTree() to give the Check a chance to do some
      initialization. Then, when performing the recursive descend from the
      root to the leaf nodes, the visitToken method is called. Unlike the
      basic examples in the pattern book, there is a visitToken counterpart
      called leaveToken(). The TreeWalker will call that method to signal
      that the subtree below the node has been processed and the TreeWalker
      is backtracking from the node. After the root node has been left, the
      TreeWalker will call finishTree().
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      If you'd like to learn more about the Visitor pattern you should
      grab a copy of the Gof
      <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsBook">Design
      Patterns</a> book.
      </p>

      <a name="regtokens"></a>
      <h3>Visitor in action</h3>
      <p class="body">
      Let's get back to our example and start writing code - that's why
      you came here, right?
      When you fire up the checkstyle GUI and look at a few source
      files you'll figure out pretty quickly that you are mainly
      interested in the number of tree nodes of type METHOD_DEF. The
      number of such tokens should be counted separately for each
      CLASS_DEF / INTERFACE_DEF.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      Hence we need to register the Check for the token types
      CLASS_DEF and INTERFACE_DEF. The TreeWalker will only call
      visitToken for these token types. Because the requirements of
      our tasks are so simple, there is no need to implement the other
      fancy methods, like finishTree(), etc., so here is our first
      shot at our check implementation:
      </p>

      <pre>
      package com.mycompany.checks;

      import com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.api.*;

      public class MethodLimitCheck extends Check
      {
        private int max = 30;

        public int[] getDefaultTokens()
        {
          return new int[]{TokenTypes.CLASS_DEF, TokenTypes.INTERFACE_DEF};
        }

        public void visitToken(DetailAST ast)
        {
          int methodDefs = ast.getChildCount(TokenTypes.METHOD_DEF);
          if (methodDefs > max) {
            log(ast.getLineNo(), "too many methods, only " + max + " are allowed");
          }
        }
      }
      </pre>

      <a name="astnav"></a>
      <h3>Navigating the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</h3>
      <p class="body">
      In the example above you already saw that the DetailsAST class
      provides utility methods to extract information from the tree, like
      getChildCount(). By now you have probably consulted the api
      documentation and found that DetailsAST additionally provides methods
      for navigating around in the syntax tree, like finding the next
      sibling of a node, the childs of a node, the parent of a node, etc.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      These methods provide great power for developing complex
      checks. Most of the checks that Checkstyle provides by default
      use these methods to analyze the environment of the ASTs that
      are visited by the TreeWalker.  Don't abuse that feature for
      exploring the whole tree, though. Let the TreeWalker drive the
      tree traversal and limit the visitor to the neighbours of a
      single AST.
      </p>

      <a name="configchecks"></a>
      <h3>Defining Check Properties</h3>
      <p class="body">

      Ok Mr. Checkstyle, that's all very nice but in my company we
      have several projects, and each has another number of allowed
      methods. I need to control my Check through properties, so where
      is the Api to do that?
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      Well, the short answer is, there is no Api. It's magic. Really!
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      If you need to make something configurable, just add a setter method
      to the Check:
      </p>

      <pre>
      public class MethodLimitCheck extends Check
      {
        // code from above omitted for brevity

        public void setMax(int limit)
        {
          max = limit;
        }
      }
      </pre>
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      With this code added, you can set the property <span
      class="code">max</span> for the MethodLimitCheck module in the
      config file. It doesn't get any simpler than that. The secret is
      that Checkstyle uses JavaBean introspection to set the JavaBean
      properties. That works for all primitive types like boolean,
      int, long, etc. plus Strings plus arrays of these types.
      </p>

      <a name="logerrors"></a>
      <h3>Logging errors</h3>
      <p class="body">
      Detecting errors is one thing, presenting them to the user is
      another. To do that, the Check base class provides several log
      messages, the most simple of them is Check.log(String). In your
      check you can simply use a verbatim error string like in <span
      class="code">log(&quot;Too many methods, only &quot; + mMax +
      &quot; are allowed&quot;);</span> as the argument. That will
      work, but it's not the best possible solution if your check is
      intended for a wider audience.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      If you are not living in a country where people speak English
      you may have noticed that Checkstyle writes internationalized
      error messages, for example if you live in Germany the error
      messages are german. The individual checks don't have to do
      anything fancy to achieve this, it's actually quite easy and the
      Checkstyle framework does most of the work.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      To support internationalized error messages, you need to create
      a message.properties file alongside your Check class, i.e. the
      java file and the properties files should be in the same
      directory.  Add a symbolic error code and an english
      representation to the messages.properties, the file should
      contain the following line: <span
      class="code">too.many.methods=Too many methods, only {0} are
      allowed</span>.  Then replace the verbatim error message with
      the symbolic representation and use one of the log helper
      methods to provide the dynamic part of the message (mMax in this
      case): <span class="code">log(&quot;too.many.methods&quot;,
      mMax);</span>. Please consult the documentation of Java's <a
      href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html">MassageFormat</a>
      to learn about the syntax of format strings (especially about
      those funny numbers in the translated text).
      </p>

      <p class="body">
      Supporting a new language is very easy now, simply create a new
      messages file for the language, e.g. messages_fr.properties to
      provide french error messages. The correct file will be chosen
      automatically, based on the language settings of the user's
      operating system.

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p class="body">
      OK, so you have written your first Check, and you have found

      <a name="filesetchecks"></a>
      <h2>Writing FileSetChecks</h2>
      <p class="body">
      Writing a FileSetCheck is pretty straightforward: Just inherit
      from AbstractFileSetCheck and implement the process(File[]
      files) method and you're done. A very simple example could fire
      an error if the number of files that are passed in exceeds a
      certain limit.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
      TODO: Implement that FSC and provide it as an example. Sketch:
      <pre>
      private int max = 100;

      public void setMax(int aMax)
      {
          max = aMax;
      }

      public void process(File[] files)
      {
          if (files != null && files.length &gt max)
          {
              // build the error list
              Object[] key = new Object[]{it.next()};

              final String bundle = pkgName + ".messages";
              errors[0] = new LocalizedMessage(
                      0, bundle, "max.files.exceeded", key);

      </pre>
      </p>
      <p class="body">
      Note that by implementing the setMax() method the FileSetCheck
      automatically makes &quot;max&quot; a legal configuration
      parameter that you can use in the Checkstyle configuration file.
      </p>
      <p class="body">
      There are virtually no limits what you can do in
      FileSetChecks. The most crazy ideas we've had so far are
      <ul>
      <li class="body">to find global code problems like unused public methods.</li>
      <li class="body">to find duplicate code.</li>
      <li class="body">to port the TreeWalker solution to check C#
